      <p>Hi, i'm Joseph. A Software Developer from London.</p>
      <p>Back in 2023, I decided that a new venture was needed, so stepped away from a Personal Training business I built from scratch to start a new career as a Software Developer.
      Since becoming a developer, I've done freelance work and built my own projects to show what I can do.
